Tensor Extraction of Latent Features (T-ELF)
=================================================

T-ELF is one of the machine learning software packages developed as part of the `R&D 100 <https://smart-tensors.lanl.gov/news/rnd100_smarttensors/>`_ winning `SmartTensors AI <https://smart-tensors.lanl.gov/software/>`_ project at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). T-ELF presents an array of customizable software solutions crafted for analysis of datasets. Acting as a comprehensive toolbox, T-ELF specializes in data pre-processing, extraction of latent features, and structuring results to facilitate informed decision-making. Leveraging high-performance computing and cutting-edge GPU architectures, our toolbox is optimized for analyzing large datasets from diverse set of problems.

Central to T-ELF's core capabilities lie non-negative matrix and tensor factorization solutions for discovering multi-faceted hidden details in data, featuring automated model determination facilitating the estimation of latent factors or rank. This pivotal functionality ensures precise data modeling and the extraction of concealed patterns. Additionally, our software suite incorporates cutting-edge modules for both pre-processing and post-processing of data, tailored for diverse tasks including text mining, Natural Language Processing, and robust tools for matrix and tensor analysis and construction.
   
T-ELF's adaptability spans across a multitude of disciplines, positioning it as a robust AI and data analytics solution. Its proven efficacy extends across various fields such as Large-scale Text Mining, High Performance Computing, Computer Security, Applied Mathematics, Dynamic Networks and Ranking, Biology, Material Science, Medicine, Chemistry, Data Compression, Climate Studies, Relational Databases, Data Privacy, Economy, and Agriculture.


Resources
========================================
* `Examples <https://github.com/lanl/T-ELF/tree/main/examples>`_
* `Website <https://smart-tensors.lanl.gov>`_
* `Code <https://github.com/lanl/T-ELF>`_


Installation
========================================
**Step 1: Install the Library**

* Option 1: Install via PIP

.. code-block:: shell

	conda create --name TELF python=3.11.5
	source activate TELF # or <conda activate TELF>
	pip install git+https://github.com/lanl/T-ELF.git


* Option 2: Install from Source

.. code-block:: shell

	git clone https://github.com/lanl/T-ELF.git
	cd T-ELF
	conda create --name TELF python=3.11.5
	source activate TELF # or <conda activate TELF>
	pip install -e . # or <python setup.py install>


* Option 3: Install via Conda

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/lanl/T-ELF.git
   cd T-ELF
   conda env create --file environment_gpu.yml # use <conda env create --file environment_cpu.yml> for CPU only
   conda activate TELF_conda
   conda develop .


**Step 2: Install Spacy NLP model and NLTK Packages**

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf
   python -m nltk.downloader wordnet omw-1.4


**Step 3: Install Cupy if using GPU (*Optional* - Skip if used Option 3 in Step 1)**

.. code-block:: shell

	conda install -c conda-forge cupy


**Step 4: Install MPI if using HPC (*Optional*)**

.. code-block:: shell

	module load <openmpi> # On a HPC Node
	pip install mpi4py # or <conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py> depending on the system


**Optional Tutorial for Examples:**
Jupyter Setup Tutorial for using the examples (`Link <https://www.maksimeren.com/post/conda-and-jupyter-setup-for-research/>`_)

**Other Considerations**
On some Linux devices, based on how CUDA was configured, you may get an error when using a GPU. Install ``cudatoolkit`` to resolve the error:

.. code-block:: shell
	
	conda install cudatoolkit
	conda install cudnn


Capabilities
========================================

Please see our `publications <https://smart-tensors.lanl.gov/publications/>`_ for the capabilities.
