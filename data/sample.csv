3cbdf992-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name,3df61d1c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df61d3a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df61d62-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df61d8a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe5c8e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1bac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe15bc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4136-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5eaa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

3cbdfa0a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2020,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbdfb18-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name,3df62f82-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe0a68-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2138-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7ac0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6328-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3b00-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5932-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2598-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0d38-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe644a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0338-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

3cbdfb86-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2007,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction.

3cbdfbcc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2007,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbdfc3a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

3cbdfc8a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1999,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers.

3cbdfdac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance.

3cbdfdca-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2009,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category.

3cbdfe38-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance.

3cbdff14-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2006,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbdff5a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2014,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbdfffa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2002,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection.

3cbe00cc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators.

3cbe0162-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2014,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service through a partnership with Los Alamos County, and detect synthetically generated anomalies.",Name,3df65e80-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe0f54-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe07e8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2728-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe64ae-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4014-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7714-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,supervisory control acquisition system often serve nervous substation power grid system facilitate real time monitor acquisition control equipment ensure smooth efficient operation substation connect device dependence scada system grow risk potential malicious intrusion significant outage even permanent damage grid dimensionality reduction base approach principal analysis accurate identification anomaly scada system specific scada negative matrix factorization strong detect anomaly wireless sensor network unsupervised approach normal expect behavior detect unseen type attack anomaly identify event deviate expect behavior approach complex multi dimensionality interaction naturally scada system differently negative tensor decomposition power unsupervised machine learn complex multi faceted activity detail scada event novelly apply tensor decomposition canonical polyadic alternate poisson regression probabilistic framework previously state art anomaly cyber network identify anomaly scada system showcase statistical behavior analysis scada communication tensor decomposition improve specific accuracy identify anomaly electrical grid system experiment real world scada collective electrical grid operation los alamos national laboratory provide transmission distribute service partnership los alamos county detect synthetically generate anomaly

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe0284-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2014,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe0310-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2004,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe0338-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2002,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe0356-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2009,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node).

3cbe037e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe03a6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2006,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena.

3cbe03ec-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2005,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe0478-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2023,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe04a0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2021,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena.

The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe04e6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"Highly specific datasets of scientific literature are important for both research and education. However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction.

3cbe0504-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2009,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe052c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2006,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available).

3cbe05cc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2023,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe05f4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe06c6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2017,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe06ee-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2020,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model.

3cbe07e8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2006,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df6a9b2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6a9d0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6a9f8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6aa16-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6aa3e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe16e8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

3cbe0856-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1998,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance.

3cbe089c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1996,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df6af52-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6af70-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6af98-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6afb6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6afde-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6affc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe3682-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2f98-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe77c8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe296c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset
3cbe08ba-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used.

3cbe09dc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2011,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe09fa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1998,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used.

The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available).

This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction.

In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe0bf8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2023,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers.

3cbe0c3e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1996,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER).

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe0cf2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2017,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe0d10-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2017,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe0d38-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2012,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

3cbe0d60-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name,3df6e954-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6e97c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6e99a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe12b0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe29b2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset
3cbe0d7e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2007,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling. We demonstrate the scalability of our distributed out of core SVD algorithm to successfully decompose dense matrix of size 1TB and sparse matrix of size 128PB with 1e-6 sparsity.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df6e9cc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6e9ea-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6ec42-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6ec74-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6ec92-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6ecba-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6ecd8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6ed00-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6ed1e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6ed46-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6ed64-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6ed8c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6edaa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe4852-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2778-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,propose efficient distribute memory implementation truncate singular decomposition heterogeneous perform compute system implementation svd singular estimation singular vector significantly memory complex propose implementation svd power truncate singular singular vector estimation memory utilization bottleneck power typically associate compute gram matrix significant dense super large sparse implementation optimize memory problem memory factorization matrix greater available gpu memory reduce memory complex batch strategy intermediate factorization compute block block suppress latency associate host device device host batch copy overlap batch copy compute cuda stream furthermore optimize communication reduce latency associate collective communication addition sparse dense matrix multiplication significantly accelerate gpu core result implementation good scale scalability distribute core svd successfully decompose dense matrix size sparse matrix size 128pb sparsity

3cbe0dec-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2018,"Highly specific datasets of scientific literature are important for both research and education. However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction.

3cbe0e14-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2020,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature.

3cbe0e82-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2016,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators.

3cbe0ee6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2014,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems.

3cbe0f0e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events.

3cbe0f36-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2017,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df7001a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df70042-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df70060-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df70088-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df700a6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df700ce-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df700ec-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df70114-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe07c0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe269c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe58c4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4e56-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0bf8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5518-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6fee-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

3cbe0fa4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2004,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

In addition, proposed ML approaches are often designed either for malware/benign-ware classification or malware family classification.

3cbe1008-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2011,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name,3df70452-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe4442-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6a30-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe56ee-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3362-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used.

3cbe1080-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2004,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe11ac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2019,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method.

3cbe1242-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2017,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

3cbe1288-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2004,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer. In our experiments, we demonstrate our approach with two MovieLens datasets and show results competitive with the state-of-the-art federated recommender systems at a substantial decrease in the number of communications.",Name;Name;Name,3df71d8e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df71dac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df71dd4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbdfcd0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe121a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe089c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7304-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,negative matrix factorization miss value completion well know collaborative filter personalize user recommender traditional rely privacy invasive collective user build central recommender shoot federate learn recently emerge mitigation privacy address traditional communication bottleneck federate learn shoot federate implementation name fedcf group user collaborative organization client apply parallel build distinct client specific recommender privacy preserve item pattern bias client share processor perform joint factorization extract item pattern extract pattern aggregate client build model information retrieval transfer experiment movielen dataset competitive state art federate recommender system substantial communication
3cbe13c8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2018,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe140e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2012,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe14a4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2020,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe1508-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2018,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name,3df65d7c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df733c8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df733f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7340e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe21ce-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score
3cbe159e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2001,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe15bc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe162a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2010,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe1698-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2009,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category.

3cbe16c0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2022,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe1706-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2014,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

3cbe172e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2021,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df74a20-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df74a48-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df74a66-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df74a8e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df74aac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df70bb4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df74ad4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df74af2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df74b1a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe23cc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5cfc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe264c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset
3cbe174c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2002,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe17ba-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2016,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance.

Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance.

The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse.

3cbe18dc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2021,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe1968-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2019,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe19ae-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2003,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer. In our experiments, we demonstrate our approach with two MovieLens datasets and show results competitive with the state-of-the-art federated recommender systems at a substantial decrease in the number of communications.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df7626c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7628a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df762b2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df762d0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df762f8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df76316-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7633e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7635c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df76384-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe6760-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbdfd66-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe33d0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2af2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe26ba-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2944-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0658-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6468-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe79bc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,negative matrix factorization miss value completion well know collaborative filter personalize user recommender traditional rely privacy invasive collective user build central recommender shoot federate learn recently emerge mitigation privacy address traditional communication bottleneck federate learn shoot federate implementation name fedcf group user collaborative organization client apply parallel build distinct client specific recommender privacy preserve item pattern bias client share processor perform joint factorization extract item pattern extract pattern aggregate client build model information retrieval transfer experiment movielen dataset competitive state art federate recommender system substantial communication

3cbe1a6c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2003,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection.

3cbe1af8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1997,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk. Good weak scaling was demonstrated on up to 4096 multi-GPU cluster nodes with approximately 25,000 GPUs when decomposing a dense 340 Terabyte-size matrix and an 11 Exabyte-size sparse matrix of

3cbe1b20-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2015,"Highly specific datasets of scientific literature are important for both research and education. However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction.

3cbe1b66-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df77324-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6549e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6fa5c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df625dc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7734c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7736a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7740a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df77428-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

3cbe1bf2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2011,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders.

These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk.

One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics.

3cbe1ddc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2016,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance.

3cbe1e68-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2020,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df78184-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df781a2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df781ca-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df781e8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df78210-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7822e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df78256-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df78274-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7829c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe405a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature.

At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction.

These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe20d4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available).

3cbe2138-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2008,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

3cbe2160-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2005,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method.

The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe21a6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df79534-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7955c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df79584-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df795a2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df795ca-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe5978-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3f10-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7930-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5afe-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5a72-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe162a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe160c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

3cbe21ec-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams.

3cbe2214-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2018,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category.

3cbe223c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2019,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe22f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe230e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2019,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams.

3cbe2336-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2022,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df79e9e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df72e64-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df79ec6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df79ee4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df79f0c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe45aa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbdf992-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4cee-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1e68-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3812-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5fea-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7930-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe302e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3db2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe23cc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2015,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df7a13c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a164-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a182-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a1aa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a1c8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a1f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a20e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a236-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a254-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a27c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a29a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a2b8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a2e0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a2fe-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a326-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a344-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a36c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a38a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a3b2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a3d0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a3f8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a416-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a43e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a45c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a484-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a4a2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a4ca-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a4e8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a510-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a52e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a556-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7a574-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe4e2e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe00cc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6328-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2944-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe663e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe446a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score
3cbe23ea-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used.

The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk. Good weak scaling was demonstrated on up to 4096 multi-GPU cluster nodes with approximately 25,000 GPUs when decomposing a dense 340 Terabyte-size matrix and an 11 Exabyte-size sparse matrix of

3cbe2458-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2022,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name,3df7bee2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7bf0a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7bf32-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe458c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4a46-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1652-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

3cbe24e4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2002,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers.

3cbe2534-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2014,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling. We demonstrate the scalability of our distributed out of core SVD algorithm to successfully decompose dense matrix of size 1TB and sparse matrix of size 128PB with 1e-6 sparsity.",Name;Name;Name,3df7c3ba-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7c3e2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7c400-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe617a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6cb0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3538-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5e3c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe432a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5a72-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2ec6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe264c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe717e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0e82-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,propose efficient distribute memory implementation truncate singular decomposition heterogeneous perform compute system implementation svd singular estimation singular vector significantly memory complex propose implementation svd power truncate singular singular vector estimation memory utilization bottleneck power typically associate compute gram matrix significant dense super large sparse implementation optimize memory problem memory factorization matrix greater available gpu memory reduce memory complex batch strategy intermediate factorization compute block block suppress latency associate host device device host batch copy overlap batch copy compute cuda stream furthermore optimize communication reduce latency associate collective communication addition sparse dense matrix multiplication significantly accelerate gpu core result implementation good scale scalability distribute core svd successfully decompose dense matrix size sparse matrix size 128pb sparsity
3cbe2552-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2020,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service through a partnership with Los Alamos County, and detect synthetically generated anomalies.",Name;Name;Name,3df6c456-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7c428-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7c450-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe023e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe390c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe658a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5cfc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe65d0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,supervisory control acquisition system often serve nervous substation power grid system facilitate real time monitor acquisition control equipment ensure smooth efficient operation substation connect device dependence scada system grow risk potential malicious intrusion significant outage even permanent damage grid dimensionality reduction base approach principal analysis accurate identification anomaly scada system specific scada negative matrix factorization strong detect anomaly wireless sensor network unsupervised approach normal expect behavior detect unseen type attack anomaly identify event deviate expect behavior approach complex multi dimensionality interaction naturally scada system differently negative tensor decomposition power unsupervised machine learn complex multi faceted activity detail scada event novelly apply tensor decomposition canonical polyadic alternate poisson regression probabilistic framework previously state art anomaly cyber network identify anomaly scada system showcase statistical behavior analysis scada communication tensor decomposition improve specific accuracy identify anomaly electrical grid system experiment real world scada collective electrical grid operation los alamos national laboratory provide transmission distribute service partnership los alamos county detect synthetically generate anomaly

The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field.

The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe264c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1997,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node).

3cbe2674-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2001,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers.

3cbe26ba-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2015,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service through a partnership with Los Alamos County, and detect synthetically generated anomalies.",Name;Name;Name,3df7ccc0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7ccde-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7cd06-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,,supervisory control acquisition system often serve nervous substation power grid system facilitate real time monitor acquisition control equipment ensure smooth efficient operation substation connect device dependence scada system grow risk potential malicious intrusion significant outage even permanent damage grid dimensionality reduction base approach principal analysis accurate identification anomaly scada system specific scada negative matrix factorization strong detect anomaly wireless sensor network unsupervised approach normal expect behavior detect unseen type attack anomaly identify event deviate expect behavior approach complex multi dimensionality interaction naturally scada system differently negative tensor decomposition power unsupervised machine learn complex multi faceted activity detail scada event novelly apply tensor decomposition canonical polyadic alternate poisson regression probabilistic framework previously state art anomaly cyber network identify anomaly scada system showcase statistical behavior analysis scada communication tensor decomposition improve specific accuracy identify anomaly electrical grid system experiment real world scada collective electrical grid operation los alamos national laboratory provide transmission distribute service partnership los alamos county detect synthetically generate anomaly
3cbe26e2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2015,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name,3df7cd2e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7cd4c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7cd6a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe5446-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe60c6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2b1a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe65b2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe06ee-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe10e4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe22f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbdfe1a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection.

3cbe2728-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1999,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams.

3cbe2750-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2014,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name,3df7d698-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6c000-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe2020-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2188-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe27be-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe21ec-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0da6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5a4a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1eae-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe52d4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1b3e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7a70-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature.

One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus.

Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe28fe-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2009,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe2994-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2015,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large

3cbe2a20-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe2a3e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service through a partnership with Los Alamos County, and detect synthetically generated anomalies.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df7f4ca-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7f4f2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7f510-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7f52e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7f556-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df63bb2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7f57e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df63b26-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df63afe-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7f5a6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7f5c4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7f5ec-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df661f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7f60a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe73fe-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6bde-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe494c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe636e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5ef0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3146-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3718-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5c66-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3268-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,supervisory control acquisition system often serve nervous substation power grid system facilitate real time monitor acquisition control equipment ensure smooth efficient operation substation connect device dependence scada system grow risk potential malicious intrusion significant outage even permanent damage grid dimensionality reduction base approach principal analysis accurate identification anomaly scada system specific scada negative matrix factorization strong detect anomaly wireless sensor network unsupervised approach normal expect behavior detect unseen type attack anomaly identify event deviate expect behavior approach complex multi dimensionality interaction naturally scada system differently negative tensor decomposition power unsupervised machine learn complex multi faceted activity detail scada event novelly apply tensor decomposition canonical polyadic alternate poisson regression probabilistic framework previously state art anomaly cyber network identify anomaly scada system showcase statistical behavior analysis scada communication tensor decomposition improve specific accuracy identify anomaly electrical grid system experiment real world scada collective electrical grid operation los alamos national laboratory provide transmission distribute service partnership los alamos county detect synthetically generate anomaly
3cbe2a66-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2017,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name,3df65804-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7f632-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe17e2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4e10-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6cb0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

3cbe2aac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2021,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe2ad4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2012,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena.

3cbe2b42-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2022,"Highly specific datasets of scientific literature are important for both research and education. However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk.

3cbe2b60-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2006,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling. We demonstrate the scalability of our distributed out of core SVD algorithm to successfully decompose dense matrix of size 1TB and sparse matrix of size 128PB with 1e-6 sparsity.",Name;Name,3df7fce0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7fcfe-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe541e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2f52-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0018-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe07c0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,propose efficient distribute memory implementation truncate singular decomposition heterogeneous perform compute system implementation svd singular estimation singular vector significantly memory complex propose implementation svd power truncate singular singular vector estimation memory utilization bottleneck power typically associate compute gram matrix significant dense super large sparse implementation optimize memory problem memory factorization matrix greater available gpu memory reduce memory complex batch strategy intermediate factorization compute block block suppress latency associate host device device host batch copy overlap batch copy compute cuda stream furthermore optimize communication reduce latency associate collective communication addition sparse dense matrix multiplication significantly accelerate gpu core result implementation good scale scalability distribute core svd successfully decompose dense matrix size sparse matrix size 128pb sparsity
3cbe2b88-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used.

3cbe2ba6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2003,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe2cc8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2002,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe2dea-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1996,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe2e58-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2023,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse.

We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node).

This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows.

Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk. Good weak scaling was demonstrated on up to 4096 multi-GPU cluster nodes with approximately 25,000 GPUs when decomposing a dense 340 Terabyte-size matrix and an 11 Exabyte-size sparse matrix of density 10−6.",Name;Name;Name,3df81d42-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df77e96-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df81d60-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe76a6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe685a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe363c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe38c6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4ad2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4cc6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5194-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1fb2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2aac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2020-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,propose efficient distribute memory implementation negative matrix factorization heterogeneous high perform compute system implementation prior nmfk perform automatic selection extract latent variable pattern extend nmfk support dense sparse matrix operation multi node multi gpu system result optimize memory problem memory factorization matrix greater available gpu memory memory complex reduce batch tile strategy sparse dense matrix operation significantly accelerate gpu core latency associate batch copy host device hide cuda stream overlap transfer compute asynchronously latency associate collective communication reduce optimize nvidia collective communication library communication benchmark significant improve 32x speedup implementation gpus cpu base nmfk good weak scale demonstrate multi gpu cluster node approximately gpu decompose dense terabyte size matrix exabyte size sparse matrix density
3cbe2f34-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2015,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category.

3cbe2f52-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2018,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name,3df81df6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe0ee6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe343e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbdfe7e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5cfc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score
3cbe2f7a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2011,"Highly specific datasets of scientific literature are important for both research and education. However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk.

3cbe2fe8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1996,"Highly specific datasets of scientific literature are important for both research and education. However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk.

3cbe3006-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe3074-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2015,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers.

3cbe30d8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2008,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name,3df827a6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe3b00-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe31dc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

3cbe3128-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2008,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe31b4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2001,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name,3df82c4c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df82c74-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset
3cbe31dc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2015,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used.

3cbe3222-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2012,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data.

This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature.

These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance.

We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe3484-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2023,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction.

3cbe3560-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2011,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe35a6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2003,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe35ce-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2017,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer. In our experiments, we demonstrate our approach with two MovieLens datasets and show results competitive with the state-of-the-art federated recommender systems at a substantial decrease in the number of communications.",Name,3df84786-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe69c2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0a68-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6c92-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5978-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe746c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe160c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3718-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,negative matrix factorization miss value completion well know collaborative filter personalize user recommender traditional rely privacy invasive collective user build central recommender shoot federate learn recently emerge mitigation privacy address traditional communication bottleneck federate learn shoot federate implementation name fedcf group user collaborative organization client apply parallel build distinct client specific recommender privacy preserve item pattern bias client share processor perform joint factorization extract item pattern extract pattern aggregate client build model information retrieval transfer experiment movielen dataset competitive state art federate recommender system substantial communication

Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df84ca4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84ccc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84cea-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84d12-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84d30-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84d58-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84d76-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84d9e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84dbc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84dda-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84e02-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84e20-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84e48-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84e66-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84e8e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84eac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84ed4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84ef2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84f1a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84f38-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbdfb5e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe67f6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe47c6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe147c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0432-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2138-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2e30-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4f96-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score
3cbe377c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2020,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe37cc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2018,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer. In our experiments, we demonstrate our approach with two MovieLens datasets and show results competitive with the state-of-the-art federated recommender systems at a substantial decrease in the number of communications.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df855e6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8560e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8562c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df85654-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df85672-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe3a06-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe19ae-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5df6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5a72-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe270a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe52d4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6328-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7566-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,negative matrix factorization miss value completion well know collaborative filter personalize user recommender traditional rely privacy invasive collective user build central recommender shoot federate learn recently emerge mitigation privacy address traditional communication bottleneck federate learn shoot federate implementation name fedcf group user collaborative organization client apply parallel build distinct client specific recommender privacy preserve item pattern bias client share processor perform joint factorization extract item pattern extract pattern aggregate client build model information retrieval transfer experiment movielen dataset competitive state art federate recommender system substantial communication

These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection.

The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field.

The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before).

3cbe3a06-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2012,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns.

3cbe3a9c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe3b00-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2018,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name,3df861d0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df861f8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df86216-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe76ce-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbdfe1a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2282-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4e7e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe575c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbdfaf0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0450-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1382-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe29f8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe3c68-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2019,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

3cbe3cf4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2001,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe3d1c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2005,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk. Good weak scaling was demonstrated on up to 4096 multi-GPU cluster nodes with approximately 25,000 GPUs when decomposing a dense 340 Terabyte-size matrix and an 11 Exabyte-size sparse matrix of density 10−6.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df86f0e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df86f36-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df82b48-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df86f5e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84ae2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df86f7c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df86fa4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df86fc2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df86fea-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df87008-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df87030-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8704e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe79e4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2f98-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe318c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,propose efficient distribute memory implementation negative matrix factorization heterogeneous high perform compute system implementation prior nmfk perform automatic selection extract latent variable pattern extend nmfk support dense sparse matrix operation multi node multi gpu system result optimize memory problem memory factorization matrix greater available gpu memory memory complex reduce batch tile strategy sparse dense matrix operation significantly accelerate gpu core latency associate batch copy host device hide cuda stream overlap transfer compute asynchronously latency associate collective communication reduce optimize nvidia collective communication library communication benchmark significant improve 32x speedup implementation gpus cpu base nmfk good weak scale demonstrate multi gpu cluster node approximately gpu decompose dense terabyte size matrix exabyte size sparse matrix density

3cbe3db2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category.

This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature.

In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method.

We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node).

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection.

3cbe3f10-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1996,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe3fec-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2001,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe4014-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2007,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature.

3cbe410e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2010,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe4136-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2002,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe4208-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2005,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures.

We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category.

3cbe4230-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2019,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer. In our experiments, we demonstrate our approach with two MovieLens datasets and show results competitive with the state-of-the-art federated recommender systems at a substantial decrease in the number of communications.",Name;Name;Name,3df890ba-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df890e2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df89100-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe6b98-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3b6e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe36f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2728-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe133c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,negative matrix factorization miss value completion well know collaborative filter personalize user recommender traditional rely privacy invasive collective user build central recommender shoot federate learn recently emerge mitigation privacy address traditional communication bottleneck federate learn shoot federate implementation name fedcf group user collaborative organization client apply parallel build distinct client specific recommender privacy preserve item pattern bias client share processor perform joint factorization extract item pattern extract pattern aggregate client build model information retrieval transfer experiment movielen dataset competitive state art federate recommender system substantial communication

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe4348-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2003,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text.

3cbe446a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2014,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df89844-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df89862-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8988a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df898a8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df898d0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df898ee-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe70ca-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3a2e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3998-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe160c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6f3a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score
3cbe4488-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2019,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe44d8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2021,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems.

3cbe453c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1999,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df8a618-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8a640-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8a65e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8a686-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8a6a4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8a6c2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8a6ea-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8a708-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8a730-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8a74e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8a776-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8a794-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe3c22-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3d8a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe502c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7084-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe235e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4ab4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe45f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2004,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

3cbe4686-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2010,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe47c6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2022,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe480c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1996,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

However, the adoption of machine learning (ML) based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow. Shortcomings in the existing ML approaches are likely contributing to this problem. The majority of current ML approaches ignore real-world challenges such as the detection of novel malware. In addition, proposed ML approaches are often designed either for malware/benign-ware classification or malware family classification.

3cbe4a46-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2002,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df8c5d0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8c5f8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8c616-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8c63e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8c65c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe5388-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4e56-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7084-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe65d0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0b8a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2dc2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2994-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7034-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe20ac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe15bc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe4c1c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1998,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe4c3a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2011,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

3cbe4c62-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1999,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

3cbe4ca8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2002,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe4d7a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2005,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

3cbe4dca-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2019,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse.

We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block.

Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe4f0a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df8e43e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8e45c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8e484-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8e4a2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df83048-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe05a4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2e80-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1ab2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3222-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6954-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

3cbe4f50-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1997,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe4fbe-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2023,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe5004-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2016,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

3cbe504a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2023,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name,3df6dfa4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe1fd0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe60ee-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe480c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe67ce-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7b24-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe09fa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe720a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe55ae-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset
3cbe5072-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2018,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df8ec86-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8eca4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8eccc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8ecea-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8ed12-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8ed30-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe1058-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe04a0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0900-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe351a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1c60-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe00f4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe5126-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1997,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events.

3cbe516c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2016,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe51b2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2023,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe528e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1997,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df8f758-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f780-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f79e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f7c6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f7e4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f802-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f82a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f852-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f870-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f898-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f8b6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7dd32-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df6cc4e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f8de-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f8fc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f924-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f942-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe6db4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6d00-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7cdc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe55ae-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4992-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5b26-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0554-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset
3cbe52b6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2001,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection.

Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive.

3cbe53b0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2003,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available).

Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe54aa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2008,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

3cbe54d2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2001,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance.

3cbe54fa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2010,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe5586-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2018,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name,3df9069e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df906bc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df906e4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df90702-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe2c3c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2b42-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0216-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1ff8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7110-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5c66-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe270a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6954-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe32ae-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6d46-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

3cbe561c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams.

3cbe563a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2003,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name,3df90c52-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df90c7a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe1030-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3560-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5220-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2020-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe548c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe14a4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

3cbe56a8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2019,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe5784-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2021,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe57f2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2021,"Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with missing-value completion is a well-known effective Collaborative Filtering (CF) method used to provide personalized user recommendations. However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe5838-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2009,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe58a6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2012,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures.

3cbe58c4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before).

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe59a0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2001,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers.

3cbe59c8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2005,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service through a partnership with Los Alamos County, and detect synthetically generated anomalies.",Name;Name;Name,3df91b48-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df91b66-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df91b8e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe3100-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0734-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe331c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbdfd84-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe52b6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe58c4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5a72-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe651c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,supervisory control acquisition system often serve nervous substation power grid system facilitate real time monitor acquisition control equipment ensure smooth efficient operation substation connect device dependence scada system grow risk potential malicious intrusion significant outage even permanent damage grid dimensionality reduction base approach principal analysis accurate identification anomaly scada system specific scada negative matrix factorization strong detect anomaly wireless sensor network unsupervised approach normal expect behavior detect unseen type attack anomaly identify event deviate expect behavior approach complex multi dimensionality interaction naturally scada system differently negative tensor decomposition power unsupervised machine learn complex multi faceted activity detail scada event novelly apply tensor decomposition canonical polyadic alternate poisson regression probabilistic framework previously state art anomaly cyber network identify anomaly scada system showcase statistical behavior analysis scada communication tensor decomposition improve specific accuracy identify anomaly electrical grid system experiment real world scada collective electrical grid operation los alamos national laboratory provide transmission distribute service partnership los alamos county detect synthetically generate anomaly

Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis.

These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature.

3cbe5cfc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena.

3cbe5d88-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2016,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus. In our experiments, we surpass both supervised and semi-supervised baseline models with an F1 score of 0.80.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df92b38-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df92b56-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df92b7e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df92b9c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df92bc4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe5cd4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe60ee-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3a9c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2f52-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6c4c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbdfbf4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5c48-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe0c3e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6468-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7138-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,identification family malware specimen belong essential understand behavior malware develop mitigation strategy solution prior often practicality lack realistic evaluation factorization factorization learn class imbalance ability identify malware cost production quality label practicality deploy model face prominent rare malware family obtain quantity date label malware train expensive address problem propose novel hierarchical semi supervise call hnmfk classify early stage malware family label negative matrix factorization automatic selection estimation cluster hnmfk classify exploit hierarchical structure malware together semi supervise setup enable classify malware family condition extreme class imbalance perform abstain prediction rejection option yield identification novel malware family help maintain perform quantity label perform bulk classification nearly rare prominent malware family static analysis nearly sample ember-2018 corpus experiment surpass supervise semi supervise baseline model score
3cbe5da6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2007,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER).

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk.

3cbe5e3c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2019,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe5eaa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2009,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe5ef0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2002,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems.

3cbe5f18-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2007,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe5f5e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2002,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available).

3cbe5fa4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name,3df93d62-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8fa28-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df7bee2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8fa96-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe7994-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5c20-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe09b4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4ca8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3cd6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5220-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3466-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe24c6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe07e8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe36f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer. In our experiments, we demonstrate our approach with two MovieLens datasets and show results competitive with the state-of-the-art federated recommender systems at a substantial decrease in the number of communications.",Name;Name;Name;Name,3df8db7e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9172e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8b540-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8db10-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe44f6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe13c8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe203e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe44b0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4bf4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe09fa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe39c0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6d8c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,negative matrix factorization miss value completion well know collaborative filter personalize user recommender traditional rely privacy invasive collective user build central recommender shoot federate learn recently emerge mitigation privacy address traditional communication bottleneck federate learn shoot federate implementation name fedcf group user collaborative organization client apply parallel build distinct client specific recommender privacy preserve item pattern bias client share processor perform joint factorization extract item pattern extract pattern aggregate client build model information retrieval transfer experiment movielen dataset competitive state art federate recommender system substantial communication
3cbe6012-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2007,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service

3cbe603a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2020,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe6080-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2005,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe60ee-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2008,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe61c0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2004,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

3cbe6206-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1996,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events.

3cbe624c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1998,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df94d20-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df94d3e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df94d66-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df94d84-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df94dac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df81d10-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df94dca-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

3cbe62e2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2015,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe6328-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2010,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers.

3cbe6396-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2022,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection.

3cbe6422-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2008,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe64d6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2009,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service through a partnership with Los Alamos County, and detect synthetically generated anomalies.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df7950c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df87814-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df96a4e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df96a8a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df96ac6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df96af8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe377c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1e22-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe02f2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe052c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6f3a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,supervisory control acquisition system often serve nervous substation power grid system facilitate real time monitor acquisition control equipment ensure smooth efficient operation substation connect device dependence scada system grow risk potential malicious intrusion significant outage even permanent damage grid dimensionality reduction base approach principal analysis accurate identification anomaly scada system specific scada negative matrix factorization strong detect anomaly wireless sensor network unsupervised approach normal expect behavior detect unseen type attack anomaly identify event deviate expect behavior approach complex multi dimensionality interaction naturally scada system differently negative tensor decomposition power unsupervised machine learn complex multi faceted activity detail scada event novelly apply tensor decomposition canonical polyadic alternate poisson regression probabilistic framework previously state art anomaly cyber network identify anomaly scada system showcase statistical behavior analysis scada communication tensor decomposition improve specific accuracy identify anomaly electrical grid system experiment real world scada collective electrical grid operation los alamos national laboratory provide transmission distribute service partnership los alamos county detect synthetically generate anomaly

The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe6544-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2001,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe6562-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2014,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe658a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2021,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category.

3cbe663e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2019,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling. We demonstrate the scalability of our distributed out of core SVD algorithm to successfully decompose dense matrix of size 1TB and sparse matrix of size 128PB with 1e-6 sparsity.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df97d0e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df97d2c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df97d54-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df97d72-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df97d9a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe2c3c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe07a2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,propose efficient distribute memory implementation truncate singular decomposition heterogeneous perform compute system implementation svd singular estimation singular vector significantly memory complex propose implementation svd power truncate singular singular vector estimation memory utilization bottleneck power typically associate compute gram matrix significant dense super large sparse implementation optimize memory problem memory factorization matrix greater available gpu memory reduce memory complex batch strategy intermediate factorization compute block block suppress latency associate host device device host batch copy overlap batch copy compute cuda stream furthermore optimize communication reduce latency associate collective communication addition sparse dense matrix multiplication significantly accelerate gpu core result implementation good scale scalability distribute core svd successfully decompose dense matrix size sparse matrix size 128pb sparsity

3cbe66ac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"Highly specific datasets of scientific literature are important for both research and education. However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer. In our experiments, we demonstrate our approach with two MovieLens datasets and show results competitive with the state-of-the-art federated recommender systems at a substantial decrease in the number

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk.

In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used.

The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available).

3cbe68f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2014,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe6954-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2004,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df99a5a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8f9e2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df99a82-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df99aa0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df99abe-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbdfdf2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

3cbe69a4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2021,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe6a12-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering.

3cbe6b70-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2023,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe6c6a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2006,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name,3df9bc74-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9bc92-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9bcba-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9bcd8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe6c4c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4082-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7296-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6bb6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2020-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2f52-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe33f8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer. In our experiments, we demonstrate our approach with two MovieLens datasets and show results competitive with the state-of-the-art federated recommender systems at a substantial decrease in the number of communications.",Name;Name;Name,3df9bd00-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9bd28-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9bd46-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe230e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe587e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe167a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1e4a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5266-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,negative matrix factorization miss value completion well know collaborative filter personalize user recommender traditional rely privacy invasive collective user build central recommender shoot federate learn recently emerge mitigation privacy address traditional communication bottleneck federate learn shoot federate implementation name fedcf group user collaborative organization client apply parallel build distinct client specific recommender privacy preserve item pattern bias client share processor perform joint factorization extract item pattern extract pattern aggregate client build model information retrieval transfer experiment movielen dataset competitive state art federate recommender system substantial communication
3cbe6cb0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2017,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service through a partnership with Los Alamos County, and detect synthetically generated anomalies.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df7c7b6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9bd6e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df83de0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9bd96-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9bdb4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9bddc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe6d1e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe65f8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5f18-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe32f4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbdfdca-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3b00-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe78e0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe479e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe35a6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5c8e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,supervisory control acquisition system often serve nervous substation power grid system facilitate real time monitor acquisition control equipment ensure smooth efficient operation substation connect device dependence scada system grow risk potential malicious intrusion significant outage even permanent damage grid dimensionality reduction base approach principal analysis accurate identification anomaly scada system specific scada negative matrix factorization strong detect anomaly wireless sensor network unsupervised approach normal expect behavior detect unseen type attack anomaly identify event deviate expect behavior approach complex multi dimensionality interaction naturally scada system differently negative tensor decomposition power unsupervised machine learn complex multi faceted activity detail scada event novelly apply tensor decomposition canonical polyadic alternate poisson regression probabilistic framework previously state art anomaly cyber network identify anomaly scada system showcase statistical behavior analysis scada communication tensor decomposition improve specific accuracy identify anomaly electrical grid system experiment real world scada collective electrical grid operation los alamos national laboratory provide transmission distribute service partnership los alamos county detect synthetically generate anomaly

3cbe6d1e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df9c098-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df84510-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9c0b6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df71dd4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df83f0c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df77e96-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe32d6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe76ce-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1008-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe018a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5eaa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1b66-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

3cbe6dfa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2010,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe6e18-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2016,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams.

3cbe6e86-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2011,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category.

3cbe6eae-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2022,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

The majority of current ML approaches ignore real-world challenges such as the detection of novel malware. In addition, proposed ML approaches are often designed either for malware/benign-ware classification or malware family classification.

3cbe6f1c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2017,"Highly specific datasets of scientific literature are important for both research and education. However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk.

These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service through a partnership with Los Alamos County, and detect synthetically generated anomalies.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df9d240-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8ab36-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df8ac08-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9d268-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9d286-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9d2ae-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe651c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,supervisory control acquisition system often serve nervous substation power grid system facilitate real time monitor acquisition control equipment ensure smooth efficient operation substation connect device dependence scada system grow risk potential malicious intrusion significant outage even permanent damage grid dimensionality reduction base approach principal analysis accurate identification anomaly scada system specific scada negative matrix factorization strong detect anomaly wireless sensor network unsupervised approach normal expect behavior detect unseen type attack anomaly identify event deviate expect behavior approach complex multi dimensionality interaction naturally scada system differently negative tensor decomposition power unsupervised machine learn complex multi faceted activity detail scada event novelly apply tensor decomposition canonical polyadic alternate poisson regression probabilistic framework previously state art anomaly cyber network identify anomaly scada system showcase statistical behavior analysis scada communication tensor decomposition improve specific accuracy identify anomaly electrical grid system experiment real world scada collective electrical grid operation los alamos national laboratory provide transmission distribute service partnership los alamos county detect synthetically generate anomaly
3cbe6f62-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2017,"Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with missing-value completion is a well-known effective Collaborative Filtering (CF) method used to provide personalized user recommendations. However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

3cbe6fa8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2021,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe6fd0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

3cbe6fee-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1995,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe7034-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2012,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name,3df9e280-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9e29e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9e2c6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe55ae-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3f56-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3416-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3998-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature.

Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer.

Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available).

The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis.

Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under

The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe7232-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2017,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name,3df9ee9c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9eec4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9eee2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9ef0a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe4e7e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe05a4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3c40-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4e2e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe77f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6dd2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbdfa0a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7d22-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset
3cbe7250-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1996,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df9ef32-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9ef50-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9ef6e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9ef96-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9efb4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df9efdc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe4fdc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe2cc8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5cfc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score
3cbe7278-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2018,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse.

3cbe73b8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2004,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe73e0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2020,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe7444-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1999,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection.

These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

3cbe76a6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2009,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk.

3cbe76ec-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2013,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer. In our experiments, we demonstrate our approach with two MovieLens datasets and show results competitive with the state-of-the-art federated recommender systems at a substantial decrease in the number of communications.",Name;Name,3df8eee8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa0c24-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe351a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7dd6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3538-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe67f6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7854-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5f36-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,negative matrix factorization miss value completion well know collaborative filter personalize user recommender traditional rely privacy invasive collective user build central recommender shoot federate learn recently emerge mitigation privacy address traditional communication bottleneck federate learn shoot federate implementation name fedcf group user collaborative organization client apply parallel build distinct client specific recommender privacy preserve item pattern bias client share processor perform joint factorization extract item pattern extract pattern aggregate client build model information retrieval transfer experiment movielen dataset competitive state art federate recommender system substantial communication

Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe77f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2018,"Highly specific datasets of scientific literature are important for both research and education. However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk.

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk.

3cbe7908-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2007,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe7930-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1996,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems.

One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes.

3cbe7a02-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2002,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus. In our experiments, we surpass both supervised and semi-supervised baseline models with an F1 score of 0.80.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3dfa2362-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa238a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df753e4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa23b2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa23d0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa23f8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa2416-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df75452-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,,identification family malware specimen belong essential understand behavior malware develop mitigation strategy solution prior often practicality lack realistic evaluation factorization factorization learn class imbalance ability identify malware cost production quality label practicality deploy model face prominent rare malware family obtain quantity date label malware train expensive address problem propose novel hierarchical semi supervise call hnmfk classify early stage malware family label negative matrix factorization automatic selection estimation cluster hnmfk classify exploit hierarchical structure malware together semi supervise setup enable classify malware family condition extreme class imbalance perform abstain prediction rejection option yield identification novel malware family help maintain perform quantity label perform bulk classification nearly rare prominent malware family static analysis nearly sample ember-2018 corpus experiment surpass supervise semi supervise baseline model score
3cbe7a2a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1999,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. As the dependence on these SCADA systems grows, so does the risk of potential malicious intrusions that could lead to significant outages or even permanent damage to the grid. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service through a partnership with Los Alamos County, and detect synthetically generated

However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection.

In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk.

3cbe7b06-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2020,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used.

3cbe7b4c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2000,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family.

However, traditional CF relies on a privacy-invasive collection of user data to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first one-shot federated CF implementation, named One-FedCF, for groups of users or collaborating organizations. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct, client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via information retrieval transfer. In our experiments, we demonstrate our approach with two MovieLens datasets and show results competitive with the state-of-the-art federated recommender systems at a substantial decrease in the number of communications.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df79d54-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa396a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3992-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa39ba-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa39d8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3a00-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3a1e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3a46-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df99d0c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3a64-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3a8c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3aaa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3ad2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df92d36-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3af0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe6d46-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4370-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe03c4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe5ed2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6134-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe11fc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe787c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe12ce-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe446a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,negative matrix factorization miss value completion well know collaborative filter personalize user recommender traditional rely privacy invasive collective user build central recommender shoot federate learn recently emerge mitigation privacy address traditional communication bottleneck federate learn shoot federate implementation name fedcf group user collaborative organization client apply parallel build distinct client specific recommender privacy preserve item pattern bias client share processor perform joint factorization extract item pattern extract pattern aggregate client build model information retrieval transfer experiment movielen dataset competitive state art federate recommender system substantial communication
3cbe7be2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2015,"We propose an efficient, distributed, out-of-memory implementation of the truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix , which can be significant when  is large and dense, or when  is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory complexity of  by using a batching strategy where the intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we use optimized  based communicators to reduce the latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an implementation with good scaling.

3cbe7c28-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1998,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6. We select one malware class to be the novel family. We showcase the performance of our approach by classifying the malware families and benign-ware, detecting the specimens belonging to the novel malware family, and report our results with Area Under the Curve of Risk-Coverage (AURC) score.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3dfa3bb8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3bd6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3bfe-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa3c1c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df74c00-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe458c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3880-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe41ea-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4bf4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe68f0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7c28-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,malware dangerous costly cyber threat organization public national security crucial factorization modern warfare adoption base solution malware threat relatively potential cost save majority malware defense solution sufficiently address follow real world challenge consider cost associate label malware supervise solution poorly generate malware train test model class imbalance rare prominent malware include incorporate ability identify novel malware family cybersecurity analyst regularly quantity malware sample understand specimen belong previously malware family classify malware sample family reduce file analyst need examine aid understand behavior malware help estimation severity threat develop mitigation strategy reduce cost spend malware analysis develop name malware dna malware family classification characterization identification state art address majority shortcoming field malware dna consider malware analogous genome dna explore hide hierarchical structure malware prior idea smarttensor platform d100 winner category recognize d100 market disruptor bronze medal enable discovery multi structure composition malware separate mix latent feature hierarchical explore semi supervise unsupervised technique yield generate malware dna analogous innovation take follow idea recently method human cancer mutation genome cause inherit disease certain cancer similarly project treat malware malicious mutation software genome target extract recognition mutation malware signature hierarchical tensor factorization incorporate automatic determination combine ability perform abstain prediction allow malware dna identify classify rare prominent malware label imbalance maintain accuracy even low quantity label detect novel malware build archive latent multi modal signature combine describe characterization complex archive rapid real time characterization classification detect unknown novel phenomenon preliminary study create catalog malware multiplication family benign specimen static analysis feature ember-2018 dataset6 malware class novel family showcase perform classify malware family benign ware detect specimen belong novel malware family report curve risk coverage score

One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes.

This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv.

3cbe7cfa-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1999,"Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus.

3cbe7d4a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,1996,"Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to organizations, the public, and national security, and a crucial factor in modern warfare. The adoption of ML-based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow despite the potential cost savings. The majority of prior malware defense solutions based on ML do not sufficiently address the following real-world challenges; considering the cost associated with labeled malware, use of supervised solutions that poorly generalize to new malware, training and testing models under class imbalance where both rare and prominent malware are included, and incorporating the ability to identify new/novel malware families. Cybersecurity analysts regularly go through large quantities of malware samples to understand if a new specimen belongs to a previously known malware family. Classifying a new malware sample into a known family reduces the number of files analysts need to examine, and aids in understanding the behavior of the malware, which is helpful for estimating the severity of the threat, developing mitigation strategies, and reducing cost and time spend on malware analysis. We have developed a new ML method, named Malware-DNA, for malware family classification, characterization, and identification that achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses major shortcomings in the field. Malware-DNA considers malware analogous to the genomic DNA, while exploring the hidden hierarchical structure of malware data without prior knowledge, using the ideas of our SmartTensors AI Platform, 2021 R&D100 winner in the IT category and recognized with an R&D100 2021 Market Disruptor Bronze Medal, enabling the discovery of multi-structure composition of malware, and separating mixed latent features. This hierarchical exploration is done based on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML techniques, yielding better generalization to new malware data. Under the DNA analogy, our innovation takes an approach that follows ideas of our recent ML methods in human cancer, the mutations to the genome can cause various inherited diseases such as certain cancers. Similarly, this project treats malware as malicious mutations (e.g., cancer) in the software genome (i.e. the computer code), and targets extraction and recognition of these new mutational malware signatures. The hierarchical approach is a tensor factorization technique that incorporates automatic model determination, combined with the ability to perform abstaining predictions (selective classification, predict “we do not know what this is”), allow Malware-DNA to identify and classify both rare and prominent malwares, work under label imbalance, maintain accuracy even when a low-quantity of labeled data is used, and detect novel malware (i.e. malware without labels or the software that we did not see before). Our method first builds an archive of latent multi-modal signatures (ALMAS) whose combinations describe and characterize complex data. This archive is then used for rapid/real-time characterization and classification of new data and detect unknown or novel phenomena. In our preliminary studies, we created a catalog of malware from multiple families and benign specimens with static analysis features from the EMBER-2018 dataset6.

3cbe7dd6-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2023,"We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous high-performance-computing systems. The proposed implementation is based on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems. The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or tensor cores when available). Input/output latency associated with batch copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) based communicators. Benchmark results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk. Good weak scaling was demonstrated on up to 4096 multi-GPU cluster nodes with approximately 25,000 GPUs when decomposing a dense 340 Terabyte-size matrix and an 11 Exabyte-size sparse matrix of density 10−6.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3dfa45c2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa45e0-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa4608-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa4626-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa464e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa466c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa4694-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa46b2-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe7bba-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe794e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe6cd8-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7d4a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1e4a-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4618-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7cdc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe72dc-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe3858-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,propose efficient distribute memory implementation negative matrix factorization heterogeneous high perform compute system implementation prior nmfk perform automatic selection extract latent variable pattern extend nmfk support dense sparse matrix operation multi node multi gpu system result optimize memory problem memory factorization matrix greater available gpu memory memory complex reduce batch tile strategy sparse dense matrix operation significantly accelerate gpu core latency associate batch copy host device hide cuda stream overlap transfer compute asynchronously latency associate collective communication reduce optimize nvidia collective communication library communication benchmark significant improve 32x speedup implementation gpus cpu base nmfk good weak scale demonstrate multi gpu cluster node approximately gpu decompose dense terabyte size matrix exabyte size sparse matrix density
3cbe7dfe-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2015,"Highly specific datasets of scientific literature are important for both research and education. However, it is difficult to build such datasets at scale. A common approach is to build these datasets reductively by applying topic modeling on an established corpus and selecting specific topics. A more robust but time-consuming approach is to build the dataset constructively in which a subject matter expert (SME) handpicks documents. This method does not scale and is prone to error as the dataset grows. Here we showcase a new tool, based on machine learning, for constructively generating targeted datasets of scientific literature. Given a small initial “core” corpus of papers, we build a citation network of documents. At each step of the citation network, we generate text embeddings and visualize the embeddings through dimensionality reduction. Papers are kept in the dataset if they are “similar” to the core or are otherwise pruned through human-in-the-loop selection. Additional insight into the papers is gained through sub-topic modeling using SeNMFk. We demonstrate our new tool for literature review by applying it to two different fields in machine learning.",Name;Name;Name;Name,3dfa46da-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa4702-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa4720-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa473e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe2552-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4032-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe4136-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe235e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe7084-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe651c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3cbe1968-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,highly specific dataset scientific literature research education difficult build dataset scale common build dataset reduction apply topic model establish corpus selection specific topic robust time consume build dataset constructively subject matter expert handpick document scale prone error dataset grow showcase tool machine learn constructively generate target dataset scientific literature initial corpus paper build citation network document citation network generate text embed visualize embed dimensionality reduction paper keep dataset similar core otherwise prune human loop selection addition insight paper gain sub topic model senmfk tool literature review apply field machine learn
3cbe7e1c-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,Paper Title,2009,"Topic modeling is one of the key analytic techniques for organizing and analysis of large text corpora. One approach to topic modeling is the recently introduced SeNMFk, a method based on semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with automatic model determination (NMFk), where the text-document matrix and word-context (co-occurrence) matrix are jointly factorized. The text-document matrix is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, and the word-context matrix represents the number of times two words co-occur in a pre-determined window of text. Incorporating the semantic structure of the text with the ability to estimate the number of topics enables a coherent separation of the latent topics and accurate document clustering. This approach, however, only identifies the highest level of topics or the main topics/themes. Many text corpora often include a very complex structure of sub-topics beyond the main themes. For example, a set of documents can be separated into main topics, such as, sports, politics, science, etc. Each of these main topics can be further separated into sub-topics. For example, sport theme can be separated to the subtopics tennis, soccer, football, etc. This process can be repeated by expanding the separation until finding all the sub-topics in the corpus. Here, we introduce a hierarchical SeNMFk approach, that can extract fine-grained sub-topics and their semantic sub-structures. By hierarchically applying SeNMFk, we break down the main topics and extract previously unknown sub-topics as well as the corresponding sub-semantic structures that can serve as narrow vocabularies – scientific-jargon seeds for local Name Entities Recognition (NER). We demonstrate our hierarchical SeNMFk method by performing topic modeling on all papers posted in arXiv, which is ~2 million+ papers. To enhance the semantic clustering in each topic, we also jointly factorize the category-text matrix, values of which represents the TF-IDF of tokens per document category. Here the categories are pre-determined/reported by the authors of the document based on its field of research in arXiv. Our results show the ability and practicality of our hierarchical SeNMFk to extract meaningful topics and find their semantic sub-structures from large datasets.",Name;Name;Name;Name;Name;Name,3df947ee-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa4770-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa478e-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa47ac-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3dfa47d4-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0;3df64620-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,3cbe3560-6781-11ee-b983-4ab2673ea3f0,topic model key analytic technique organization analysis text corpora topic model recently introduce senmfk semantic negative matrix factorization automatic determination text document matrix word context matrix jointly factorization text document matrix frequency inverse document frequency matrix word context matrix represent time word occur pre determination window text incorporate semantic structure text ability topic enable coherent separate latent topic accurate document cluster identify high topic topic theme text corpus often complex structure sub topic theme set document separate topic sport politic science topic separate sub topic sport theme separate subtopic tennis soccer football repeat expand separate find sub topic corpus hierarchical senmfk extract fine grain sub topic semantic sub structure hierarchical apply senmfk break topic extract previously unknown sub topic correspond sub semantic structure serve narrow vocabulary scientific jargon seed name entity recognition hierarchical senmfk perform topic model paper post arxiv paper enhance semantic cluster topic jointly factorization category text matrix represent idf token document category category pre determination report author document field research arxiv ability practicality hierarchical senmfk extract meaningful topic semantic sub structure dataset
